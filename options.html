  <p>Loan Calculator | Options</p>
  <p>
      Letâ€™s say you took out a loan for $20,000 with an annual percentage rate (APR) of 6 percent and a
    repayment term of 10 years. In that case, you would take the amount you borrowed and multiply it by your interest
    rate. This would represent your annual interest costs, which you would divide by 12 months.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Example:</strong>

    $20,000 x .06 = $1,200 in interest each year

    $1,200 divided by 12 months = $100 in interest per month
